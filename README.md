working-markdown
================

This repo was the place for scripts to fold reproducible computations into markdown systems, a spinoff on the WorkingWiki project.

The code I started here has been folded into WorkingWiki.  The WorkingWiki Subversion repo is at https://sourceforge.net/p/workingwiki/code/HEAD/tree/.
